# 🤝 Contribution Guidelines — ECWOC

We welcome contributions from everyone! To maintain code quality and smooth collaboration, please follow the guidelines below before contributing.

---

## 📌 Before You Start
- Check **existing issues** before creating a new one.
- If a **similar issue already exists**, any newly created duplicate issue **will be closed**.
- If no relevant issue exists, create a **new issue** with clear details, logs, or screenshots (if applicable).

---

## 🌱 Branching Rules
- ❌ Do **NOT** work directly on the `main` branch.
- Always create a **new local branch** from `main`:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
````

* Use meaningful branch names such as:

  * `feature/authentication`
  * `fix/api-error`
  * `docs/readme-update`

---

## 🧪 Local Testing (Mandatory)

* Run the project on your **local server** before pushing changes.
* Ensure:

  * The application runs without errors
  * Your changes work as expected

⚠️ Pull Requests without local testing may be rejected.

---

## 🔀 Creating a Pull Request (PR)

* Push your branch to the repository:

  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```
* Create a **Pull Request (PR)** targeting the `main` branch.
* Clearly mention:

  * What changes were made
  * The issue number it resolves (e.g., `Fixes #12`)
  * Screenshots or screenrecording
  * star the repo for further updates

---

## 🚫 Important Rules

* ❌ Do **not** merge directly into `main`
* ❌ Do **not** push commits to `main`
* ✅ Wait for **maintainer review and approval** before merging

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
* Follow the project’s coding standards
* Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
